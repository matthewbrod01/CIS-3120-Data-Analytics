# CIS-3120-Data-Analytics
This is my first ever programming project I completed with my group back in Dec 2017, for a Data Analytics class.

A [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/sniperarrow/information-on-dental-magic-employees/data) was used for Data Analysis.
Our goal was to analyze an employee HR dataset to find out which factors could best explain the employee's pay-rate.

The following features have been implemented:

- [x] Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn API are imported
- [x] Data has been transformed and restructured for linear regression
- [x] Heatmap implemented for variable correlations
- [x] Various plots are shown for relevant predictor variables
- [x] Linear regression is performed
